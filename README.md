### Brief
An application made for everyone from film enthusiasts to movie newbies which allows
them to read films and genres from tables; add new film and genre entries if it is 
not already in the database; update film and genre entries
delete entries from a database. It will include film titles, age rating, duration
and other details. 


### Future Improvements
This application successfully implemented CRUD functionalities. I want to focus more
on TDD
I want to improve the project testing and hope to see the overall coverage increase to at least...
In future, I would love the application to be more user friendly by adding... for example if there was no genres/films
message to prompt to add genre/film
Add order by eg:genre as mentioned in user stories
